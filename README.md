Data Collection:

Obtain restaurant data from Zomato or another relevant source. You can use web scraping techniques or APIs to collect data. Make sure to gather features such as restaurant location, cuisine type, user ratings, and more.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the collected data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering:

Create relevant features that can improve the accuracy of your price prediction model. For example, you can calculate the average rating of a restaurant's cuisine in a specific location.
Model Development:

Choose a machine learning algorithm for price prediction. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, or random forests.
Split your dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Train and fine-tune your model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Make necessary adjustments to improve the model's accuracy.
Model Deployment:

Create a Flask web application to deploy your machine learning model. You can structure your Flask app as follows:
plaintext
Copy code
├── app/
│   ├── static/
│   │   ├── styles.css
│   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── index.html
├── app.py
├── model.pkl
└── requirements.txt
app.py: The main Flask application script.
model.pkl: Your trained machine learning model saved as a pickle file.
static/: Folder for static files like CSS and JavaScript.
templates/: Folder for HTML templates.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages required for your project.
Flask Application:

Create routes in your Flask app to handle user input, make predictions using the model, and display the results.
Use HTML templates for user interfaces, allowing users to input restaurant features.
Load the trained model (model.pkl) in your Flask app and use it to predict restaurant prices.
Deployment:

You can deploy your Flask app to various platforms, including Heroku, AWS, or a web hosting service.
Ensure you follow the deployment guidelines of your chosen platform.
Testing:

Test your deployed app thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
Documentation:

Create documentation for your project, including instructions on how to use the web application.
Maintenance:

Regularly update your model and web application to keep them accurate and up to date.
Monitoring:

Implement monitoring to keep track of your app's performance and user interactions.
Scaling:

If your application gains popularity, consider scaling it to handle increased traffic and data.
